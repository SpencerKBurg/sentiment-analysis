# sentiment-analysis
This is a classifier to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative

This was my capstone project for the Advanced Machine Learning class in the Machine Learning Certificate Program at the University of Washington - Professional and Continuing Education

Much of the word embeddings code is from code that Stuart Owen Axelbrooke shared in his "A Brief History of Sentiment Classifiers" presentation to the NLSEA Meetup on 4/8/2019 https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/events/259884581/

I used crawl-300d-2M.vec for the word embeddings. It is 4.5 GB and too big to put on github. It should be easy to find and download online.
